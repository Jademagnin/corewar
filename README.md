# corewar Epitech project

## Description
Corewar is a programming game where players write code (Warriors) to compete against each other in a virtual machine. The objective is to eliminate opponents by causing their programs to execute illegal instructions or by surviving longer.
This project was carried out with [ZKAW](https://github.com/ZKAW) [mezzlmc](https://github.com/mezzlmc) and [louislafosse](https://github.com/louislafosse) produced during my first year at Epitech.
